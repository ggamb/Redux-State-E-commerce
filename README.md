## Description
I refactored my own Shop Shop code (from [this](https://github.com/ggamb/shop-shop) repo) to change the global state from React's Context API to Redux.

Shop Shop is an e-commerce site with Stripe payment system that allows users to sign up/login, add items to their carts, and checkout using a credit card. In the shopping cart, users can manipulate the number of items they want to buy of a particular product and can delete products from their carts. To quickly find items, users can sort the items by category. Shop Shop comes loaded with seeded products.

## Installation
If you would like to play with the code, clone the code to your machine, open the root of the project in your favorite IDE, run `npm i` to install dependencies, and then `npm run develop` to run the server and client concurrently.

## Usage
Simply use [this](https://shop-shop-redux-refactor.herokuapp.com/) Heroku link for the deployed application.
